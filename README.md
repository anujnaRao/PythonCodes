# PythonCodes
Programs implimented using basic Python concepts

# Important Points to remember in Python
 - No Semicolon or termination  
 - Indentation is a must 
 - No use of Paranthesis or flower braces 
 - Use of colon in front of condiotional and looping statements
 - No declaration of variables

# Data Types
 - Number
 - String
 - List
 - Tuple
 - Set
 - Dictionary
 
 # Different Types of Comments
 - Single line Comment
 - Multiline Comment
 
 - ' # ' For single line
 - """ """ or ''' ''' For multiline
 
 # Variables
 - No need of declaring a variable
 - Direct assignment of values to the variables
 - No datatype specification is needed
 - The variable takes the type of the value assigned

# Scope of a Variable 
- Local Scope
- Global Scope
  Local Scope is when a variable is assigned and used within a function
  Global Scope is when a variable is assigned and used throught the program
  
  But in Python same variable used inside and outside the function acquires different scopes
  Both variables hold different places in memory
  
# List
- [] is the representation of list
- It is can unordered, can contain duplicates and can have any type of values in it
- It is mutable

# Tuples
- () is the representation of tuple
- It is unordered, can contain duplicates and can have any type of values in it
- It is immutable
- The last value should be followed by a comma(,)

# Dictionary
- It is Key-Value Pair
- It is ordered, Keys are immutable but values are mutable
- It cannot contain duplicates
- Values can be accessed with keys
